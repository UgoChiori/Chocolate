                My name is Ugo Chiori, some people call me AdaOhafia, others call me Chef Yougee, and I love coffee and baking.<br> Currently, I am a very proud AltSchooler, studying for a diploma in Front End Engineering. Lately though, the idea of being
                a Cloud Engineer has been appealing to me a lot. Will I be a Cloud Engineer or a Front End Engineer? Time will tell.<br> It is a full switch for me, switching from the Arts, to Tech especially as I am a graduate of Linguistics.<br> I knew
                I needed to do something far removed from what I was comfortable with, and known for- something way out of my scope, so here we are, coding and all- strange things are happening, I tell you.<br> I am a third generation baker, and I run
                my small baking and cooking business in Lagos. I have been doing this for as long as I can remember. <br> A lifetime ago, I used to be a choreographer and a makeup artist, but life happened, or adulthood, and I cannot seem to find the
                time for that pastime anymore.<br> Baking is also a hobby for me. I also enjoy collecting coffee mugs and all kinds of coffee. Everyone says I am a coffee addict, but they are bad vibes. There is no such thing as "too much coffee".<a href="./AboutUgo.html">Home</a>
