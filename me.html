            My name is Ugo Chiori, some people call me AdaOhafia, others call me Chef Yougee, and I love coffee and baking. Currently, I am a very proud AltSchooler, studying for a diploma in Front End Engineering. Lately though, the idea of being a Cloud Engineer
            has been appealing to me a lot. Will I be a Cloud Engineer or a Front End Engineer? Time will tell. It is a full switch for me, switching from the Arts, to Tech especially as I am a graduate of Linguistics. I knew I needed to do something
            far removed from what I was comfortable with, and known for- something way out of my scope, so here we are, coding and all- strange things are happening, I tell you.I am a third generation baker, and I run my small baking and cooking business
            in Lagos. I have been doing this for as long as I can remember. A lifetime ago, I used to be a choreographer and a makeup artist, but life happened, or adulthood, and I cannot seem to find the time for that pastime anymore. Baking is also
            a hobby for me. I also enjoy collecting coffee mugs and all kinds of coffee. Everyone says I am a coffee addict, but they are bad vibes. There is no such thing as "too much coffee".
